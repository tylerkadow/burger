# EAT DA BURGER!

This fully functioning website utilizes a MySql database. It allow you to create, throw away, and devour a "burger."
It also utilizes an npm package called handlebars. This lets you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration. Instead of actual html files, this project utilized handlebars files, which was a very simple way to pull data from a database and place those items on the web page where I wanted them to go; whether the burger was "devoured" or "not devoured."
